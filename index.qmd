## Consultation

If your main focus is research, technical difficulties can sometimes be a nuisance. I can help get you started, or answer more specific questions about a technology or a piece of code.

A typical request can look like this:

- For my project I am interested in posts from this website, how can I get those?
- I have a large amount of data; how can I structure it and make it accessible to my colleagues?
- I am using this software in my study but shouldn't run it on my laptop, what are the alternatives?


## Software projects

If you have an idea for a project, but need someone to write the actual code, get in touch. Some examples:

:::{#projects}
:::


## Cloud support

Working at a Dutch university, you have various local and national options to host or run your code. I can help you with that choice, get you started, or support the entire deployment process.

## Training

Want to learn how to program yourself?

I am a Carpentries instructor and at the UvA we regularly organize workshops, teaching programming and software management skills such as version control. I post upcoming workshops on this website:
