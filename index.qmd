## Training

Want to learn how to program yourself?

At the UvA, we regularly organize workshops in which we teach programming and software management skills such as version control. The events will be listed on the [events page of the Data Science Center](https://dsc.uva.nl/events/events.html). 
If there is no workshop coming up, you can always study the material yourself, e.g. [an introduction to Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/)
